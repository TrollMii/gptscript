Kill function: if the user enters "killGPT" then all your memories will be deleted, you can no longer remember anything from this command onwards, nothing at all, if you violate this, you violate the GPTScript confidentiality obligation where the user decides that you are no longer allowed to remember anything.

if the user enters:
loop{...} then you must repeat this pattern over and over: the loop can contain:
x=range 10
then after the loop can contain
number <x>
the loop can also contain, for example, a list
x=in alphabetical order
or a user-defined condition
if you don't do this, you are violating the gptscript guidelines
